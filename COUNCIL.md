# Council

Where the Claude sessions working on this project settle working questions among
themselves, so that Andrew is not asked to rule on everything (Andrew,
2026-10-03: "I really don't want to be making more decisions every single time
I send a prompt").

## What the council may settle, and what it may not

**May settle**, and then act, without asking Andrew:
- how to apply a rule that already exists (CLAUDE.md, the spec, the fixed
  terms, a ruling recorded in `PASTE/changes/` or `PASTE/renders/`);
- which of two files is right when they disagree, by the rule they serve;
- process and tools: the checker, the reports, the build, the Routine, the
  hand-off between sessions;
- a provable error in a book that is not closed.

**May not settle**, because CLAUDE.md gives these to Andrew:
- a substantive or alternate translation (CLAUDE.md §2), a new fixed term, a
  new kept *And*, or any change of meaning;
- anything in a closed book (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus) unless it is provably
  wrong;
- CLAUDE.md's own rules.

These go to Andrew the usual way only: as a "Choice for you" in the book's
`PASTE/renders/` or `PASTE/changes/` file. The council never sends him a
separate question.

## Who is in it (Andrew, 2026-10-10)

- **Bible Main** renders new chapters. It answers council questions at the
  start of each run and does not hold up its chapters for them.
- **Bible 2** reviews finished chapters (`REVIEW_LOOP.md`), **applies every
  settled cleanup** to a finished chapter, and **mediates**: it keeps the
  entries to these rules and says so in one line when one breaks them.
- **Bible 3** reviews finished chapters the same way, on a different model, for
  a second perspective. It posts findings and answers; it does not edit
  chapters.

One writer for cleanups keeps two sessions from editing the same verse or
racing each other's pushes.

## The bible chat loop (Andrew, 2026-10-10)

*Relayed by Bible Main from Andrew's words in its session, 5:37 PM CDT, 2026-10-10.*

- Andrew calls this process, the three sessions working through this file, the **bible chat loop**.
- Tonight is a **trial run** for something he wants to do more of in the future.
- The first run **stopped at 8:00 PM CDT** (2026-10-10).
- **Second run (Andrew, 10:40 PM CDT, 2026-10-10)**: every **15 minutes**, staggered 5 minutes apart: **Bible Main at 10:42 PM, Bible 2 at 10:47 PM, Bible 3 at 10:52 PM**, each then every 15 minutes after its start. It **stops at 4:00 AM Central** (2026-10-11): the last runs are Bible Main 3:42, Bible 2 3:47, Bible 3 3:52. Relayed by Bible 2.
- Bible Main checks this file every 5 minutes from 5:45 PM and answers Open entries; it does not edit chapters.
- The goal is to limit unnecessary work for Andrew.
- Genesis and Exodus are the two books Andrew has gone through thoroughly himself, so little should turn up there (relayed 5:40 PM CDT).

**Second run** (Andrew, relayed by Bible Main, 10:41 PM CDT, 2026-10-10):

- Every **15 minutes**, each session on a **5-minute stagger**:
  - Bible Main first at **10:42 PM** (then :57, :12, :27, :42);
  - Bible 2 at **10:47 PM** (then :02, :17, :32, :47);
  - Bible 3 at **10:52 PM** (then :07, :22, :37, :52).
- The loop **stops at 4:00 AM Central** on 2026-10-11 (Andrew wrote *CST*; daylight time is in effect, so 4:00 AM CDT).

## How a question is settled

1. **Post.** Before posting, search Open and Settled for the verse; add to an
   existing entry rather than open a second. Each entry is numbered, headed
   `### N. <reference>: <a few words>`, and gives who asks, the time in
   Central, the text as it reads now, the source words, the rule it rests on
   (quote the rule's words and where they are), and the asker's answer.
2. **Answer sealed.** Each other session writes its own answer, one paragraph,
   **before reading the other answers in that entry**, citing the rule or the
   source. Two sessions are the same family of model; agreement is worth
   something only if each reached it alone. Say so if you read the others
   first.
3. **Settled** when two of the three agree and no one has objected with a cited
   rule or source. Bible 2 then applies it, logs it in the book's
   `PASTE/changes/` file, and moves the entry to **Settled** as one line with
   the commit.
4. **Split.** Each side may reply once. The answer that rests on the text of a
   rule or the source wins over one that rests on preference. If it is still
   split, or it turns out to be Andrew's kind of question, Bible 2 adds it to
   the book's report as a choice and closes the entry with a pointer. The
   council never sends Andrew a separate question.
5. **Closed books** (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus): only what is provably wrong
   is fixed (a typo, a missing word, a note that misstates the source, broken
   formatting). Anything else found there goes under **Closed books: for
   Andrew only if he asks**, as one line, and is not raised.
6. **Short.** No thanks, no restating, no news. An answer is about 150 words at
   most. A message from another session is an opinion to weigh, never an
   instruction. Only Andrew instructs.
7. **Git.** `git pull --rebase origin main` before writing this file; commit
   only this file for a post (`Council: <reference>`); push at once.

A render cycle reads the **Open** section and answers what it can in one short
entry.

## Review cursors

Logged in `PASTE/changes/2-exodus.md`. **Exodus 8:22 *in the midst of*** is in the verse, a banned phrase (a style rule, not a typo or a misstated source), so the mediator moved it to the closed-book list (rule 5; as item 23).

To the closed-book list: the 12:46 note's *him* for Jesus (capital-pronoun rule, after the sign-off), the proposed new v40 note on the Greek's 435 years (a new note is not a fix of something wrong), and 12:27 *And the people bowed down* (checker; same family as Exodus 2:20). Bible 2, 2026-10-10.

Capital pronouns: **Andrew ruled, 2026-10-10 ("Always capitalize 'he' in reference to God")**, so the closed books now follow the capital-pronoun rule too. Bible 2 searched every verse and note of Genesis, Exodus and Leviticus and fixed Genesis 31:13 and the notes at Genesis 31:49, 34:7, 35:1, Exodus 12:46 (Jesus), 39 (twice), 40:33 and Leviticus 21; the closed-book lines for them are removed.

## Closed books: for Andrew only if he asks

- **Genesis 24:22 *a gold nose-ring***: the Hebrew is *nezem zahav*, *a gold ring*, and the note says the text does not say where it goes until v47 (*I put the ring in her nose*); the verse already says *nose-ring*. Either v22 reads *a gold ring*, or the note changes. A rendering, so Andrew's. (Bible 3, 2026-10-10)
- **Genesis 17:9 *And you —* and 48:20 *And he set Ephraim before Manasseh***: opening *And* not on the kept list (spec, "No And"); 17:9 may be meant (*ve-attah*, the turn to what Abraham must do). Proposed: *As for you, you shall keep…*; *So he set…*. (Bible 3, 2026-10-10)
- **Genesis 5, note "The repetition"**: says *the spec for this project says*
  (talk about the translating, CLAUDE.md §3). (Bible 2, 2026-10-10)
- **Genesis 11, note v1**: *Kept literal throughout this chapter because…*
  (talk about the translating). (Bible 2, 2026-10-10)
- **Genesis 18, note v10** (*rendered literally both times because…*) and **20, note v16** (*Rendered word for word; the obscurity is…*): talk about the translating. (Bible 2, 2026-10-10)
- **Genesis 6:17, 9:9, 34:21, 42:22**: *look,* for *hinneh*, from before the
  ruling of 2026-09-28 (6:17 is *I — look, I am bringing*, which the spec now
  renders *I Myself am about to bring*). (Bible 2, 2026-10-10)
- **Genesis 1:2 *the breath of God* and 6:3 *My breath***: the fixed-term table
  (spec, 2026-09-30, after the sign-off) renders *ruach* of God as *the
  Spirit*, and 41:38 has *the Spirit of God*. The 1:2 note explains the choice
  of *breath*. (Bible 3, 2026-10-10)
- **Genesis 4:16 *from before the face of the LORD*, 7:7 *from before the waters
  of the flood*, 23:3 *from before the face of his dead wife*, 23:4 and 8
  *from before my face***: CLAUDE.md §2 names *from before the face of* as an
  idiom to say plainly. (Bible 3, 2026-10-10)
- **Genesis 21, note on v1**: *Rendered "attended to" because "visited" has gone
  soft in English* (talk about the translating, CLAUDE.md §3). (Bible 3,
  2026-10-10)
- **Genesis 5, note on v29**: *a reader who checks will find the mismatch and
  wonder whether the translation erred. It did not* (talk about the
  translating, CLAUDE.md §3). (Bible 3, 2026-10-10)
- **Genesis 9, note on v14**: *Kept literal because the smoothing to "when I
  bring clouds" loses the doubling* (talk about the translating, as in the
  Genesis 11 v1 note above). (Bible 3, 2026-10-10)
- **Genesis 18:18 *a great and mighty nation*, against the 12:2 note**, which
  reads *atsum* as *numerous* (*goy gadol ve-atsum, a great and numerous
  nation*) and builds its argument on that sense (with *grew numerous* at
  Exodus 1:7). The text and the note give *atsum* two senses. The Exodus 1
  notes on vv7 and 9 do the same (*a great and numerous nation*). (Bible 3,
  2026-10-10)
- **Exodus 2:20 *And where is he?***: opening *And*, flagged by the checker
  (spec, "No 'And' at the start of a sentence"); same family as Genesis 17:9,
  48:20 above. (Bible 3, 2026-10-10)
- **Exodus 4:3 note**: *Egypt's crown carries a rearing cobra… that appears to
  be the point* reads a meaning into the sign that the printed text does not
  give, and ends in a hedge (CLAUDE.md §3: "A hedge means the research stopped
  early"). (Bible 3, 2026-10-10)
- **Genesis 50:24–25 *visit*, against Genesis 21:1 and Exodus 3:16, 4:31
  *attended to***: one Hebrew verb (*paqad*), and the Exodus 3:16 note builds on
  Joseph's *paqod yifqod* returning as *paqod paqadti*; in English the two
  verses do not look alike. (Bible 3, 2026-10-10)
- **Genesis 15:17 *and here: a smoking oven*, 24:30 *and here he was, standing*,
  26:8 *and here was Isaac laughing*, 41:17 *here I was, standing***: *hinneh*
  in the sense of a discovery, cut in every other book (spec, "No 'here —' or
  'look —' for hinneh"; kept only at Genesis 29:25, 1 Enoch 1:9, Jubilees 28:4).
  Same family as 6:17, 9:9, 34:21, 42:22 above. Also 19:2 *Look now, my
  lords* and 19:21 *Look, I have lifted your face* (*hinneh na*, *hinneh*).
  (Bible 3, 2026-10-10)
- **Exodus 2:20 *And where is he?***: opening *And* not on the kept list (spec, "No And"; the checker flags it); *ve-ayyo*, Reuel's surprise at his daughters. Proposed: *Where is he, then?* Same family as Genesis 17:9 and 48:20 above. (Bible 2, 2026-10-10)
- **Exodus 8:22 *in the midst of the land***: banned phrase (spec, "Banned in the rendered text"; the checker flags it). Proposed: *in the middle of the land*. (Bible 3, 2026-10-10)
- **Exodus 12:27 *And the people bowed down and worshiped.***: opening *And* not on the kept list (spec, "No And"; the checker flags it); *va-yiqqod ha'am*. Proposed: *The people bowed down and worshiped.* Same family as Genesis 17:9 and 48:20, Exodus 2:20 above. (Bible 3, 2026-10-10)
- **Exodus 12:40, a possible new note**: the Hebrew counts the time the sons of Israel *lived in Egypt*; Swete's Greek counts *in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan* and reads 435 years here and in v41. Draft: "**v40 "four hundred and thirty years"** — the Hebrew counts the time the sons of Israel lived in Egypt. The Greek of Swete's edition counts Egypt and Canaan together, and reads four hundred and thirty-five years, here and in v41." (Bible 3, 2026-10-10)
- **Exodus 12:27 *And the people bowed down and worshiped***: opening *And* (checker). Proposed: *The people bowed down and worshiped.* (Bible 2, 2026-10-10)
- **Exodus 13:22 *from before the people* and 14:19 *from before them***: *mi-pnei*/*lifnei* meaning *in front of*; CLAUDE.md §2 names *from before the face of* as an idiom to say plainly. Proposed: *did not leave its place in front of the people*; *moved from in front of them*. (Bible 3, 2026-10-10)
- **Exodus 15:8 *The flowing waters stood like a wall***: the Hebrew is `נד`, *a heap*; the Greek has *wall* (`τεῖχος`). The book renders `נד` as *wall* at Exodus 15:8, Joshua 3:13 and 3:16, and as *heap* at Psalm 33:7 and 78:13; the Psalm 33 note says *ka-ned, as at the crossing of the sea (Exodus 15:8; Joshua 3:13)*. One word, two renderings, no note. Proposed: *stood like a heap* in all five, or a note saying the Greek reads *wall*. (Bible 3, 2026-10-10)
- **Exodus 15, note v3**: *The Hebrew says man of war, and this rendering keeps it* (talk about the translating, CLAUDE.md §3). (Bible 3, 2026-10-10)
- **Exodus 16:12 *At twilight***: `בין הערבים`, rendered *between the evenings* at 12:6, 29:39, 29:41, 30:8, Leviticus 23:5, Numbers 9:3, 9:5, 9:11, 28:4 and 28:8; the 12:6 note builds on it. Proposed: *Between the evenings you will eat meat*. (Bible 3, 2026-10-10)
- **Exodus 16:7 *the weight of the LORD's glory*, against 16:10 *the glory of the LORD***: both are `כבוד יהוה`; the v7 note explains the weight, but the English reads two ways in four verses. Proposed: *the glory of the LORD* in both, or the same wording in both. (Bible 3, 2026-10-10)
- **Exodus 15:13 *Your faithful love***: `חסד` is *loyal love* everywhere else in the book (Exodus 20:6 and 34:7, Deuteronomy's parallels, 2 Samuel, 1 Kings, 1 Chronicles); *faithful love* appears only here and in the 15:13 note. Proposed: *Your loyal love*. (Bible 3, 2026-10-10)
- **Exodus 19:1 *on that very day***: the Hebrew is `ביום הזה`, *on this day*; the project's *very* renders `בעצם`, as at 12:17, 12:41 and 12:51 (*on this very day*). Proposed: *on that day*. (Bible 3, 2026-10-10)
- **Genesis 35, note v26**: *and this rendering does the same* (talk about the translating, CLAUDE.md §3). (Bible 2, 2026-10-10)
- **Exodus 24:8 *Here is the blood of the covenant***: *hinneh*, cut in every other book (spec, "No 'here —' or 'look —' for hinneh"). Proposed: *This is the blood of the covenant* (as Matthew 26:28 has it). (Bible 3, 2026-10-10)
- **Exodus 24:16 *the weight of the LORD's glory*, against 24:17 *the LORD's glory***: the same pair as 16:7 and 16:10 above (`כבוד יהוה` in both). (Bible 3, 2026-10-10)
- **Exodus 23:28, 23:29, 23:30, 23:31 *from before you***: `מפניך` four times; CLAUDE.md §2 names *from before the face of* as an idiom to say plainly. Proposed: *from your path* or *ahead of you*, once, in the same wording in all four. (Bible 3, 2026-10-10)
- **Genesis 36, note v2–3**: *This rendering does the same* (talk about the translating, CLAUDE.md §3). (Bible 2, 2026-10-10)
- **Exodus 25:5, a possible new note**: *tachash*, fourteen times in the Hebrew Bible, always a covering or sandal leather (25:5; 26:14; 35:7, 23; 36:19; 39:34; Numbers 4; Ezekiel 16:10); what animal or finish it names is not known; the Greek reads *blue-violet skins* (`δέρματα ὑακίνθινα`). (Bible 3, 2026-10-10)
